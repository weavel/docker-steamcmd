## SteamCMD: Base Image for Steam Gameservers

The Steam Console Client or SteamCMD is a command-line version of the Steam client.
Its primary use is to install and update various dedicated servers available on Steam using a command-line interface.
It works with games that use the SteamPipe content system. All games have been migrated from the deprecated HLDSUpdateTool to SteamCMD.
